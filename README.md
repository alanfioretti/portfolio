An interactive, OS-inspired portfolio built with React.  
This portfolio presents projects, prototypes, and experiments through a custom file-explorer interface, blending clean UI structure with subtle narrative and glitch aesthetics.

Built to showcase real-world frontend architecture, state management, and intentional UI design - not just screenshots.

Built with **React** + **Vite**.

### Features

- Custom file-explorer style navigation
- Deterministic back navigation with explicit view state
- Project and prototype separation
- Corrupted prototype flow with repair sequence
- Responsive layout across desktop and mobile
- Minimalist, OS-inspired UI with glitch accents

### Tech Focus

This project highlights:

- Explicit navigation state management
- Clear separation of view state vs. content state
- Component responsibility boundaries
- Conditional rendering without routing libraries
- Debuggable, predictable UI flow
- Production-ready React structure using Vite

### Deployment

This portfolio is deployed via **Cloudways**, using a standard production build generated from the full source repository.

### Foundation of the Rook Ecosystem

This project serves as the primary portfolio hub for my work and experiments, including smaller sandbox demos and prototype builds.
